**Trussle is a company with big ambitions.** We're only small, but you might have heard about us in The Telegraph, The Financial Times or on the BBC. [We've secured over £1.2M of investment](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/06/trussle/) and signed a long-term partnership with [Zoopla](http://www.zpg.co.uk/media/news-releases/zoopla-property-group-invests-leading-uk-proptech-start-ups). Our plans are even bigger. You can find out more about us at [trussle.com](https://trussle.com).

Trussle is built on software; if we weren't, we'd just be another mortgage broker. We're using software and clever thinking to tackle the hard problems in our field. How do you simplify a process as complicated as getting a mortgage? What happens when banks *don't* have APIs? And how do you build a personal service that scales to thousands of applicants per day?

**We'd like to meet talented, self-driven and ambitious software engineers** to join our team and help us build what mortgage advisers will look like in the future.

We prefer analytical, problem-solving mindsets over years of experience. We like to experiment with our tools, architecture and process to make it easier and faster to build things. Communication is key as small companies grow, so we need engineers that are happy to explain, challenge and assess our progress - to their team and to the wider company.

We're a [full-stack Javascript](http://stackshare.io/trussle/trussle) house at the moment, but we're not precious about it: we'll use the right tool for the job. We try to work in an [agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) fashion because it means we can get things done. And we have the usual perks like bean bags and [stuffed toys](/2016/06/08/emergency).

**Interested?** Send us your CV and we'll ask you a few questions. After a chat on the phone, we'll bring you into the office and ask you to pair with us for a while and meet the rest of the team. And that's it - if we like what we see and you love what we're doing we'll ask you to join us. (See? We like things simple.)
