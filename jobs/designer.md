**Trussle is a company with big ambitions.** We're only small, but you might have heard about us in The Telegraph, The Financial Times or on the BBC. [We've secured over £1.2M of investment](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/06/trussle/) and signed a long-term partnership with [Zoopla](http://www.zpg.co.uk/media/news-releases/zoopla-property-group-invests-leading-uk-proptech-start-ups). Our plans are even bigger. You can find out more about us at [trussle.com](https://trussle.com).

We want to be the market leader, and we think delivering an amazing user experience is how we will do it. Our website needs to be beautiful, smooth and easy to understand. We need to supply the right information at the right time. And we need to provide an experience that our users will tell their friends about. We think companies like [Oscar](https://www.hioscar.com/), [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/) and [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/) are doing it right, and we want to be like them.

**We're looking for a passionate designer** to turn Trussle into a design-driven company. You'll be our first full-time designer, working with our product manager, software engineers, mortgage advisers and founder to solve problems, direct our visual identity and design user experiences our users love.

You will obsess about the customer, making sure the business is driven by user need. Your curiosity to experiment with interfaces and behaviour will make us a unique service. And your knowledge of UI/UX principles, web design and design tools will provide clever solutions to difficult problems.

We don't want someone who hides away and churns out pixel-perfect designs on their own - we don't think it works. We need a collaborator who takes the initiative, talking to mortgage advisers and users to figure out what needs to be done and prototyping creative but feasible solutions. We need a great communicator, sharing their ideas with our software engineers in an efficient way and supporting them as they build.

**Interested?** Send us your portfolio and let us know what makes you different from the rest. From there we'll bring you into the office to see how you work. And that's it - if we like what we see and you love what we're doing we'll ask you to join us. (See? We like things simple.)
