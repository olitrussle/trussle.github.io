**Hello!** We're the Trussle Product Development Team. We make stuff for [Trussle](https://trussle.com/), the new hassle-free way to find and secure a mortgage online.

We thought we needed a website for us to talk about software, technology and other things we like. One or two afternoons later, here we are.

We're just starting to release some of our cool tools as open source software. When we do, it'll be on [our Github page](https://github.com/trussle), and we'll announce it here as well.

If you want to get to know us, check out our [team profiles](/about). Better still, send us a message [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TrussleTech).

We hope you like it!
