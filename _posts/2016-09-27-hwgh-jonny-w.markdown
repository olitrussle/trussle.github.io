*How We Got Here* is a series of posts from our Product Development team giving you a bit of history - how did we end up at Trussle, doing the job we're doing now?

First up is Software Engineer Jonny Wildey.

Since I can remember I always liked making things. I was obsessed with Lego when I grew up.  For most of my life this drive fell into music. I really enjoyed recording music, and during my teens it was just about becoming possible to record and produce music on normal computers. But they crashed a lot, software was buggy and you needed to learn a bit about computers to be able to use them to make music. So I had to understand computers a bit just to get audio cards and drivers to work.

So I studied music at university, and there's these strange kind of graphical programming languages like [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) that I used. I know graphical programming languages are kind of looked down on but I think there's something really intuitive about them. I still occasionally mess around in Pure Data and make myself an arpeggiator or something.

But there's this weird connection between music and programming that isn't just about music using technology. There's a surprising amount of musicians who code, and there are also software engineers who are into really arcane music like bellringing. I think it's got something to do with music, particularly music notation, being a formal language; it works in a very similar way to programming. 

After university I had to get an office job. A lot of it was going over things in Excel, making sure Names were capitalised, addresses were correctly spelt, etc. At some point I realised I could probably get Excel to do a lot of the work for me, so I learnt some VBA. This proved successful, and they made me write more VBA, work with databases and other techy stuff. At the time I found the courses on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) very helpful. After a while I realised I actually enjoyed that kind of work. So I decided to do a Masters in Computer Science.

Probably the most helpful aspect of the Masters was it helped me to think like an engineer. There are a lot of things I don't like about engineering culture, and I don't know if I'm really an engineer, but engineers are incredibly good at making things efficient and robust, and that's helped with a lot of other aspects of my life.
