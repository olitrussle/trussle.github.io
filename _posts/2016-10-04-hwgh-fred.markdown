I've always had a passion for art and design since graduating in Graphic Design in 2012 where I was chosen to represent my university at the [D&AD Awards](http://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-awards/). 

Before I joined Trussle I was was the Lead Designer from the beginning at [Babylon Health](http://www.babylonhealth.com/), another UK start-up. I was drawn to Babylon Health because it was a company I believed in, and it felt good working for a company that helps other people's lives in some way. When I was there I had exposure to lots of influential people and learned a lot from them.

This same philosophy attracted me to Trussle: I could be part of an exciting and highly motivated team pulling together to create a service with a big positive impact on people's lives. It's also great that I can help shape the future of applying for and handling mortgages, an industry in dire need of modernisation.

I've only been in the company for a few weeks, but I've done a lot! I've recently rolled out a rebrand for the company that better reflects its mission and values. I'm looking forward to being involved with the brand, marketing and product design in the future.
