*How We Got Here* is a series of posts from our Product Development team giving you a bit of history - how did we end up at Trussle, doing the job we're doing now?

First up, it's Software Engineer Jonny Arnold...

My route into software mainly revolves around Christmas.

I've been into computers since a [Sega Mega Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis) landed in my house as a Christmas present when I was just about able to speak. ([Sonic The Hedgehog 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2) is the best game ever; no exceptions.) This started a fascination with computer games [that continues to this day](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115152272/games/?tab=all).

A few years later, I received [The Games Factory](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Europress-The-Games-Factory-PC/dp/B003SEH4MC) for Christmas. This software - unsurprisingly, from the title - allowed you to build your own games, and I was obsessed with it; every night I'd come home and try to put the final tweaks on my latest weird idea for a game. Thankfully those games are now hidden away on a probably-wiped hard drive, but this was certainly the catalyst for building software.

My first foray into web programming was also for a game. I had come up with the idea of a role-playing forum where people would come and write intertwined stories with each other in a fictional post-apocalyptic world. (I was a teenager, go figure.) To do this, I decided I needed to learn PHP, HTML and JavaScript, so I started teaching myself using free resources online and the Try Something And See If It Breaks Approachâ„¢.

The rest, as they say, is history. I made a bunch of websites for university societies when I should have been studying, and landed my first real software job just after I graduated. Not bad, given I had no formal training!

One of the things I'd always fancied doing was joining a start-up: working in small teams has always been something I'd enjoyed and seen great results out of, so it seemed to make sense that a small company would work for me. I joined in March 2016 and I've had a great time since!
